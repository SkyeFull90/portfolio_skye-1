## Nextra Portfolio Blog

> Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.

Next.js and a library called Nextra,
it allows you to write Markdown and focus on the content of your portfolio or blog.
That can be leveraged with the blog feature, which is what I used in my Nextra Blog portfolio.
Which you can see [here](https://nextra-portfolio-blog.vercel.app/).
You can build your own with the [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/) template.
Which is fairly easy to use and has a lot of features, including vercel integration.

### Nextra

Nextra was initially created by Vercel members Shu Ding and Paco Coursey in 2020. Since 2021,
Yixuan Xu contributed tremendously to the project.
In 2022, Dimitri Postolov from The Guild joined the core team to help with the development of 2.0.
Read the [documentation](https://nextra.vercel.app/) to learn more.

Learn how to build your own portfolio blog with Nextra and NextJS from Vercel below.

#### Portfolio Starter Kit

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/).
It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.
This starter includes:

- Automatically configured to handle Markdown/MDX
- Generates an RSS feed based on your posts
- A beautiful theme included out of the box
- Easily categorize posts with tags
- Fast, optimized web font loading

## Configuration

1. Update your name in `theme.config.js` or change the footer.
2. Update your name and site URL for the RSS feed in `scripts/gen-rss.js`.
3. Update the meta tags in `pages/_document.tsx`.
4. Update the posts inside `pages/posts/*.md` with your own content.

## Deploy your own
