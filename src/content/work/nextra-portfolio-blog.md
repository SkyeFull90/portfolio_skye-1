## Nextra Portfolio Blog

> Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.

Next.js and a library called Nextra, 
it allows you to write Markdown and focus on the content of your portfolio or blog.
That can be leveraged with the blog feature, which is what I used in my Nextra Blog portfolio.
Which you can see [here](https://nextra-portfolio-blog.vercel.app/).
You can build your own with the [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/) template. 
Which is fairly easy to use and has a lot of features, including vercel integration.

### Nextra

Nextra was initially created by Vercel members Shu Ding and Paco Coursey in 2020. Since 2021, 
Yixuan Xu contributed tremendously to the project. 
In 2022, Dimitri Postolov from The Guild joined the core team to help with the development of 2.0.
