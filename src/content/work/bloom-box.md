## Events By Three Blog

Events By Three My first project with Xata and Astro.
I tasked myself with creating a site for a fictional event sharing company.
I used Astro to build the site and Xata to manage the content.
The site features a blog, a contact form, and a gallery of past events.
The site is fully responsive and features a clean, modern design.
The search feature allows you to find the right event you are looking for.

Also, events by three will have a new Fastapi full-stack blog version deployed straight from a docker file.
Combining the best of fast and efficient client side from Astro only shipping the javascript you want.
And sleek, smooth and fast back-end.
Using a REST API framework built on python similar to Flask that is fast and efficient.
Like a nice python version of Express.
